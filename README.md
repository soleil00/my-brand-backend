# My Brand Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for my portfolio website. This repository houses the server-side logic and database operations for managing and serving data related to my portfolio.

## Description

The Portfolio Website Backend powers the dynamic functionalities of my portfolio. It's the engine that drives seamless interaction between the frontend and the database. Crafted with Node.js and Express, this backend solution ensures smooth handling of server-side operations, including authentication and authorization for protected routes. MongoDB serves as the trusty database companion, securely storing and managing the wealth of project data, blog posts, and other essential information showcased on my portfolio website.

## Bonus

To enhance user engagement and acknowledge interactions with my portfolio, this backend utilizes Brevo for sending transactional emails. With Brevo integration, users receive prompt and personalized emails in response to their actions on the portfolio website. This asynchronous communication ensures that users feel valued and appreciated for their engagement. It's a small but significant addition that aims to foster a stronger connection between visitors and my portfolio, enriching the overall user experience.
